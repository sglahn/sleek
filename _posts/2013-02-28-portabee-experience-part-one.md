(Click here for [Part two](/2013/10/06/portabee-experience-part-two/)).
I received my unassembled [Portabee 3d printer](http://romscraj.com/carttoo/index.php?route=product/product&#38;path=64&#38;product_id=122) kit. The Portabee is not only the world´s first portable 3d printer it is also affordable. I want to share my experiences. The Portabee is based on the [RepRap Wallace](http://reprap.org/wiki/Wallace) and uses 3 mm PLA filament and a 0.5 mm extruder nozzle. The build volume is 120x120x120 mm. With an 365 Euro price tag unassembled the Portabee is really cheap. But you should keep in mind the shipping costs of ~75 Euro plus ~90 Euro Import VAT (Einfuhrumsatzsteuer) at least here in Germany. That makes a total of ~530 Euro. The lead time was about 4 weeks, shipping took 3 days.

Here is what you will find in the box: The printed parts (red), 1kg 3mm PLA filament (red), the motors (two z motors, an x motor, an y motor and the extruder motor), the printbed, a lot of nuts, washers, bearings, bolts, screws, rods, the electronics a modified [Gen6](http://reprap.org/wiki/Generation_6_Electronics) board and the endstops). Also provided is a spirit level, 3 wrenches, Kapton tape a pack of instant coffee and more.

The quality of the printed parts that come with the Portabee is very good. The step by step assembly instructions (One for the [printer](https://github.com/downloads/romscraj/Portabee/Portabee-Assy-V1-0-PDF-HiRes.pdf) and one for the [extruder](https://github.com/downloads/romscraj/romscraj-extruder/RomscrajExtruder-AssyV1-0-PDF-HiRes.pdf)) are very detailed but outdatet at several places. The bare-bones case design of the printer is very minimalistic (but in a good way) and pragmatic.

A problem occured with the endstops. They came not as they should because they are soldered the other way around. After a small adaption (basically a rotation) they are working.

In my kit one z shaft coupling is a weak point. The coupling doesn´t hold the nut very good. Now the rod is pressed into the coupling basically by the weight of the x axis and the extruder. I´m not sure how bad that affects the printing process.

The extruder and the heatbed involves some soldering. The Portabee uses a [Wade Extruder Version 3](http://reprap.org/wiki/Wade%27s_Geared_Extruder) which is a complex and heavy thing.

In the process of wiring I found out that I hadn´t checked the length of the motor cables which is different so I had to unscrew the motors and switch them.

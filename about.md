My name is Sebastian Glahn. I'm a father, husband and Senior Software Engineer living in Cologne. Some of my professional interests include Java, Vim, Gradle and Docker. Besides my job I'm interested in Retro Gaming, Microcontrollers, 3D printing and ambitious Linux-based mobile operating systems like Maemo or Sailfish OS. I also maintain a few open source projects. 

I have 10+ years experience building software and would describe myself as DevOps-Minded - with a strong focus on build, test and deployment automation. Currently I'm helping migrating an enterprise-scale monolithic platform to a Microservice architecture.
